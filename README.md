# ALTTPR Tracker

This is an item tracker designed for **A Link to the Past Randomizer (ALTTPR)**, helping players track items, dungeons, and progression in the game.
It displays all of the locations in most modes of gameplay. The spoiler log can be loaded so that players can see what items they've collected, what checks are missing and peak at spoilers if needed.

## TODO

Optional logic hints to be added. Locations will be outlined with green if they're accessible, orange if checkeable, blue if only accessible in complete darkness, or red if impossible with current items.
Logic should assume Glitchless logic, non-Enemizer and no entrance shuffle.

UI Improvements and Dark/Light mode toggle.
